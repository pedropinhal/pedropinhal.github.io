I have recently finished up a contract, and am currently looking for work.

I was previously working with a [financial services company](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedropinhal/) setting up a platform for individuals to create and manage IRA investments. This was a really interesting problem domain as it catered the US Invesment market. As usual with IT projects, it was a high pressure delivery environment and I'm really proud of the work we did. I wish the team all the best going forward!

Hence, if you need a solid pair of hands, Agile coach or Scrum Master, or just a general IT dude, please get [in touch]({{site.url}}/cv)!
